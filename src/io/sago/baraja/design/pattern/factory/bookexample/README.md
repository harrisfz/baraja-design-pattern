**Factory Pattern** - Factories handle the details of object creation.

Itâ€™s more of a programming idiom. But it is commonly used
- **The Factory Method Pattern**
Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
